Redux is a simple, truly extensible and fully responsive options framework for WordPress themes and plugins. Ships with an integrated demo.

== Description ==

Redux is a simple, truly extensible and fully responsive options framework for WordPress themes and plugins. Built on the WordPress Settings API, Redux supports a multitude of field types as well as custom error handling, custom field & validation types, and import/export functionality.

But what does Redux actually DO? We don't believe that theme and plugin
developers should have to reinvent the wheel every time they start work on a
project. Redux is designed to simplify the development cycle by providing a
streamlined, extensible framework for developers to build on. Through a
simple, well-documented config file, third-party developers can build out an
options panel limited only by their own imagination in a fraction of the time
it would take to build from the ground up!

cool!

== Installation ==

1. Copy the "~/redux-framework/sample/" directory from within the plugin to a directory within your own theme or plugin.
2. Click on "Deactivate Demo Mode" in the "Plugins" area of the WordPress admin panel to turn off the Redux integrated demo.
3. Edit the "~/sample/sample-config.php" file (now copied to your plugin or theme directory) and change the $args['opt_name'] value to anything custom you would like. Make sure this is truly unque so other plugins/themes can use Redux.
4. Include the sample-config.php file: `require_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/sample/sample-config.php');` in your theme functions.php file or within your plugin's init file.
